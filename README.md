Abstract:The vehicle recognition of unmanned aerial vehicles is often affected by environmental uncertainties when detecting ground vehicles, such as occlusion, illumination, viewpoint, season, and perceptual aliasing. However, traditional deployed models are often in static offline modes, preventing models from learning new data to overcome environmental changes. Nevertheless, the drone cannot equip traditional centralized hardware architecture because of the payload limitation, which is more difficult to develop for model training and adaptive capability for the drone. Furthermore, because the decision-making of the model is like a black box, the detection results cannot be explained, and thereby results are not too trustworthy. Therefore, this thesis proposes four solutions. First, establish a distributed adaptive architecture that can be federated learning, and then cycle this architecture, the drone will be able to continuously update the global model to adapt to environmental changes and reduce the training duration. Second, establish a dataset with various uncertainties to provide early training for the model. Third, design a luminance optimization block to improve the detection performance under low-illumination conditions. Finally, visualization techniques to explain the detection results, thereby increasing the trustworthiness of the findings. After testing, the distributed architecture achieved a mean Average Precision of 60.6% and a training duration of 6.35 hours, increasing by 0.6% and reducing by 23.3% respectively compared to the centralized architecture. The mean Average Precision is further improved by 2.3% in the first round of the adaptive mechanism. This result shows that the distributed adaptive architecture can continuously overcome environmental changes.
